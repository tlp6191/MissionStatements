c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:==Goals and mission==
c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:Wild Spirit has three primary missions: education, sanctuary, and rescue:&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws_rescue&quot;/&gt;
c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:
c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:* Education: &quot;To educate the general public about wolves, wolfdogs, and other related species and our environmental and ecological issues related to wildlife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws_mission&quot;/&gt; Wolf Ambassadors from the sanctuary travel around the state and nearby areas to meet people at events and in classrooms. They offer first-hand knowledge that wolves are not the [[Big Bad Wolf]] of fairy tales such as [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. On-site tours let better understand the animals and the necessity for sanctuaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws_main&quot;/&gt;
c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:* Sanctuary: &quot;To operate and manage a lifetime sanctuary for displaced, unwanted, and un-releasable captive-bred wolves, wolfdogs, and other related species, utilizing such resources as may be available from local, city, state, and private entities or individuals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws_mission&quot;/&gt;
c3|Wild_Spirit_Wolf_Sanctuary:* Rescue: While Wild Spirit receives between one and seven calls every day from people requesting that the sanctuary take their wolves or wolfdogs off their hands, WSWS is at full capacity. The majority of new animals are high-content wolfdogs or wolves being rescued from extreme situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws_main&quot;/&gt;

c3|International_FOP_Association:==Founding and history==
c3|International_FOP_Association:[[File:Jeannie L Peeper.jpg|thumb|left|Jeannie L Peeper &lt;br&gt;IFOPA Founder and President]]IFOPA was founded in 1988 by Jeannie L. Peeper. Diagnosed with FOP in 1962 at age four, Peeper graduated from college in 1985 with a bachelor of arts degree in social work. [[Michael Zasloff]], then at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), was studying FOP and put Peeper in contact with all FOP patients known to the NIH, eighteen in total, to whom Peeper mailed a questionnaire. Eleven responded. In early 1988, Peeper started a newsletter called ''FOP Connection'' in collaboration with Nancy Sando, one of the respondents. In June of that year, Peeper founded the IFOPA to facilitate fund raising for FOP research and generally create awareness of the disease. With an initial association membership of eleven, Peeper became the inaugural president and Sando was appointed vice president. In 1989, Peeper collaborated with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to support establishment of the FOP Collaborative Research Project, and in 1992, the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders, efforts spearheaded by Drs. Frederick S. Kaplan, Michael Zasloff, and Eileen M. Shore.
c3|International_FOP_Association:
c3|International_FOP_Association:Throughout the 1990s, IFOPA organized two international symposiums on FOP and several FOP family meetings. In the first decade of the 2000s, two more international symposiums were hosted by IFOPA, and other FOP scientific and family meetings were held in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.  In April 2006, the Center for Research in FOP discovered the FOP gene. By 2014, the organization had over 500 members from 57 countries and had partnered with FOP organizations and communities in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, The Netherlands, People's Republic of China, Poland, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:==Mission and goals==
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:According to the NhRP's website, the mission of the Nonhuman Rights Project is, through education and litigation, to change the common law status of at least some nonhuman animals from mere “things,” which lack the capacity to possess any legal right, to “persons,” who possess such fundamental rights as bodily integrity and bodily liberty and those other legal rights to which evolving standards of morality, scientific discovery, and human experience entitle them. To advance this mission, the NhRP's specific goals are:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:1. To persuade a United States state high court to declare that a specific nonhuman animal is a legal person who possesses the capacity for a specific legal right.
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:2. To persuade US state high courts to increase the number of legal rights of any nonhuman animal who is declared to be a legal person to the degree to which it should be entitled.
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:5. To communicate to the public and media the NhRP’s mission and the justice of recognizing specific nonhuman animals as legal persons.
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:6. To educate the courts, the legal profession, the media, and the public about the state of current knowledge about the cognition of those nonhuman animals who are, or who might be, plaintiffs in the Nonhuman Rights Project’s lawsuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission, Goals, and Values&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission, Goals, and Values|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/mission-goals-values/|work=NhRP Website|publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:==Legal claims==
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:The NhRP argues that nonhuman animals who are scientifically proven to be self-aware, autonomous beings, such as [[great apes]], [[elephants]], [[dolphins]], and [[whales]], should be recognized as legal persons under U.S. common law, with the fundamental right to bodily liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Are You a Legal Person or a Legal Thing?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Are You a Legal Person or a Legal Thing?|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/about-us-2/|work=NhRP Website|publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project|accessdate=September 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626085624/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/about-us-2/|archivedate=June 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NhRP, there is nothing in the common law that suggests that legal personhood is limited only to human beings, and certain species fit the profile that courts have used in the past to recognize legal personhood. The NhRP emphasizes the fact that currently all nonhuman animals are considered merely property, or legal &quot;things,&quot; without the capacity for rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Should Chimpanzees Have Legal Rights?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Should Chimpanzees Have Legal Rights?|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/07/13/should-chimpanzees-have-legal-rights/Mv8iDDGYUFGNmWNLOWPRFM/story.html|work=Chris Berdick|publisher=Boston Globe|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published five months before the NhRP first filed suit, Chris Berdick of ''Boston Globe'' explains the organization's claims and strategy as follows:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:{{Quote|text=Armed with affidavits from scientists, including Jane Goodall, about chimps’ capacities, [the NhRP] will argue that their plaintiff deserves a right to liberty, and that its captivity is a violation of that right. Win or lose, they plan to bring more habeas petitions on behalf of other animals, hoping to win enough small victories to lay a foundation of precedent for animal personhood. It’s unlikely to be a quick and easy fight, but Wise says he accepts that he’s in the animal-personhood game for the long haul. “This is a long-term, strategic, open-ended campaign,” he says.&lt;ref name=&quot;Should chimpanzees have legal rights?&quot;/&gt;}}
c3|Nonhuman_Rights_Project:Some legal scholars have publicly opposed the NhRP's mission and goals. Federal appeals judge [[Richard Posner]], for example, is opposed to legal personhood for nonhuman animals on the basis that the law grants humans special status not because of their intelligence but out of &quot;a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Should chimpanzees have legal rights?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Should a Chimp Be Able to Sue Its Owner?|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/07/13/should-chimpanzees-have-legal-rights/Mv8iDDGYUFGNmWNLOWPRFM/story.html|work=Chris Berdick|publisher=Boston Globe|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney and Pepperdine Professor of Law Richard Cupp has argued that [[animal welfare]] laws should be sufficient for ensuring the well-being of captive nonhuman animals and that the NhRP's strategy is unnecessarily extreme. In an interview with the James Gorman of ''The New York Times'' following the organization's first lawsuits, Cupp said, &quot;The courts would have to dramatically expand existing common law for the cases to succeed.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Considering the Humanity of Nonhumans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Considering the Humanity of Nonhumans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/considering-the-humanity-of-nonhumans.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=Jim Gorman|publisher=New York Times|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the NhRP argues that an animal welfare approach is insufficient and ineffective in terms of ending the practice of keeping chimpanzees and other cognitively complex nonhuman animals in captivity and also does nothing to address the larger issue of their status as legal property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Live Chat: Should Animals Be Granted Legal Rights&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Chat: Should Animals Be Granted Legal Rights|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/plants-animals/2013/12/live-chat-should-animals-be-granted-legal-rights|work=Jim Gorman|publisher=ScienceNOW|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George''' is the founder and leader of the Motor City Blight Busters. Besides Angel’s Night, John George’s first action in forming Blight Busters was buying plywood and boarding up a house that was being used as an operations base by drug dealers around the corner from his house. After it was boarded up, he found that this worked because the drug dealers did not return to that location.&lt;ref name=&quot;modeldmedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Clare Pfeiffer Ramsey |url=http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/blightbusters.aspx |title=Who Ya Gonna Call? |publisher=Modeldmedia.com |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they first started, John George only had a Lincoln Town Car, but now has made a smart investment, and bought a full-size pickup truck. Blight Busters did not just appear; plenty of work was spent in creating this organization. It started off in John George’s basement with a couple of volunteers. Once it grew too big for his basement, they purchased a building on Lahser Road for one dollar. They put 1.4 million dollars into turning the place around, and making it the headquarters for the Blight Busters.&lt;ref name=&quot;metrotimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Guyette |first=Curt |url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=12962 |title=News+Views: Blight buster |publisher=Metro Times |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, the organization then known as Christmas Party, Inc. began mailing gifts certificates to a number of parents in low-income households from a list obtained from the Department of Welfare in Baltimore. The idea was that a gift from a parent is appreciated more by the children than a gift received from a stranger. In 1948, the group started an annual dance to benefit their mission. By 1956, the group changed the organization's name from Christmas Party, Inc to Santa Claus Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas charity dance. (1954, Nov 07). The Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

c3|John_Lennon_Educational_Tour_Bus:The '''John Lennon Educational Tour Bus''' (&quot;Lennon Bus&quot;) was founded in 1998 as a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] organization &quot;committed to reaching youth through music and video&quot;. While corporately based in New York City, the mission of the organization is carried out through a traveling bus,  an audio and video recording studio on wheels. With the very newest technology and gear, the Bus continues to be dedicated to providing young people with tours of the studios and participation in free songwriting and multimedia production workshops. With the assistance of three on-board engineers, students learn how to write, perform, and record original songs, plus produce and shoot music videos or documentaries, completing a broadcast-quality production in a single visit.

c3|Special_Operations_Warrior_Foundation:
c3|Special_Operations_Warrior_Foundation:The SOWF was founded in 1980 following the failed attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran.  The doomed mission was plagued with problems from the start, but it ended in disaster when a helicopter and C-130 gunship collided in the desert of Iran, at a location now referred to as &quot;Desert One,&quot; killing eight military personnel and severely incapacitating another. The fallen warriors left behind 17 children.  The survivors took it on themselves to provide college educations for the children of their fallen comrades.

Thus, in 1995 the Family Liaison Action Group (established to support the families of the 53 Iranian hostages) and the Spectre (Air Force gunship) Association Scholarship Fund merged to form the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; In 1998 the foundation extended the scholarship and financial aid counseling to also include training fatalities since the inception of the foundation in 1980.

With $200,000 from Coors, the Analysis and Research Association was created in 1970. New supporters and board members joined, including [[petroleum]] executive [[Edward Noble]] and [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. Eventually, the organization split into a public interest law center and a separate public policy foundation, the latter of which was incorporated as The Heritage Foundation on February 16, 1973. Weyrich was its first president. Later, under president Frank J.

c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:
c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:* '''1968:''' Three volunteers meet in a church basement and create a loosely organized housing hotline to connect Miami Dade Community College (now [[Miami Dade College]]) students with potential roommates and landlords. City officials contact the volunteers for help with the anticipated Vietnam War protestors who would likely create havoc as the Republican National Convention convened here. They agree and the &quot;housing hotline&quot; begins to receive calls from visiting dissenters that go beyond housing needs to a myriad of issues such as hunger, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and so on. Because many of the callers were young, the housing hotline was nicknamed the &quot;hippie hotline.&quot;
c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:* '''1970:''' The organization officially incorporates as Switchboard of Miami, Inc. and continues to offer HELPline services.
c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:* '''1980:''' Direct, face-to-face prevention and clinical services for youth and their families are offered in schools and the community to help strengthen and maintain local family units.
c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:* '''1980-81:''' Over 125,000 Cubans arrive in South Florida as part of the [[Mariel Boatlift]]. About 10% of the refugees were from mental institutions and prisons and are in need of crisis services. The HELPline expands to offer a special hotline specifically for the immigrants. Services are offered in English and Spanish. Several years later, Creole is added.

c3|Switchboard_of_Miami:Although Switchboard has been in business for over 40 years, there are people in Miami who are not aware of the organization's existence. They lack the visibility that an organization with such a long history might be expected to have. Many believe the 2-1-1 hotline is answered by The Children's Trust and associate the line with the company, even though Switchboard answers the line and provides the services for it. While thousands of people rely on Switchboard's services and may even have been helped by the organization in the past, they are sometimes unable to associate the organization's brand with its services.

c3|Promoting_Enduring_Peace:PEP's mission, reformulated in 2007 to fit the post-Cold War circumstances of the 21st Century, is to contribute to transforming the reigning social paradigm from one of competition to cooperation, from a culture of violence and war to a global commonwealth devoted to the wellbeing of all who share it. The updated mission statement anticipates a convergence of dangers previously considered as separate and discrete, in which each danger compounds the others, paralleling the convergence of systems that characterizes globalization. It states that a rapid and peaceful transition is required from an unsustainable civilization steeped in institutionalized violence, exploitation, and profligate consumption to a commonwealth based on universal harmony, mutual respect, and a love of the Earth and all beings who call it home. The mission statement also states that PEP intends to devote significant effort and resources to achieving a fusion of peace, environmental, and social movements, in the belief that these causes are interdependent and none can succeed unless all succeed.

Once their needs are determined, Seacology makes a deal with the local community, offering to provide the needed service in return for a forest reserve or a no-take fishing area around a coral reef.  Facilities such as schools and community centers are built using local labor, and Seacology provides approximately $20,000 for supplies and to facilitate the construction.{{r|SFGate_13Apr2008}}  Seacology has field representatives stationed around the world who monitor and report the progress of the projects in their region, as well as seek new projects in their respective regions or islands.

c3|SERRV_International:== History ==
c3|SERRV_International:SERRV International was launched in 1949. It began as a program of the [[Church of the Brethren]] as a way to help refugees in Europe recover economically and socially from [[World War II]]. The name SERRV is an acronym for Sales Exchange for Refugee Rehabilitation and Vocation. It first imported wooden cuckoo clocks from Germany to Maryland to sell in the U.S.
c3|SERRV_International:The program grew from assisting World War II refugees to working with impoverished people throughout the world. SERRV began importing handicrafts from the world's least developed countries as a way to alleviate poverty. By 1960, with the help of Church World Service, a nationwide network of churches were selling SERRV crafts as part of their mission work. In 1964, the first full-time director was hired and three staff members were appointed.
c3|SERRV_International:
c3|SERRV_International:In 1999, SERRV International split from the Church of the Brethren to become an independent 501(c)(3) organization. Sales at this time had reached more than $5.5 million and the product line branched out into [[fair trade coffee]] and [[chocolate]] as well as [[handicrafts]]. SERRV became the U.S. distributor of Fair Trade [[Divine Chocolate]], the first farmer-owned chocolate company in the world.
c3|SERRV_International:
c3|SERRV_International:In 2001, in addition to marketing fair trade products, the organization stepped up its efforts as a development organization. Its current development projects with artisans and farmers include skill training workshops, product design assistance, and small grants, all largely funded by charitable contributions to SERRV from individuals, foundations, and churches.

c3|Lesbian_Health_Initiative_of_Houston:==History==
c3|Lesbian_Health_Initiative_of_Houston:LHI was established in 1992 in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], by a group of [[lesbian]] women who were working in medical services. By that time, new medical research had revealed lesbians were at higher risk of [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[cervical cancer]] than their straight counterparts. It became a [[501(c)(3) organization]] in 1994. The same year, LHI created a study called the Houston Area Health Care Needs Assessment for LGBT Women, to assess the issues LHI would address. The study found that 1 in 4 LGBT women had barriers that restricted their access to medical care, ranging from finances to discrimination, and the same number of women were assumed [[heterosexual]] by healthcare providers. 25% of these women also reported signs of cancer within the previous year before the study. Additionally, trends indicated high stress, alcohol consumption, and tobacco usage levels among these women, and indicated a desire among the community for better access to adequate healthcare.&lt;ref name=&quot;vol&quot;/&gt;

c3|New_York_Academy_of_Sciences:==History==
c3|New_York_Academy_of_Sciences:Founded on January 29, 1817, the New York Academy of Sciences was originally called the Lyceum of Natural History.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaatzHistory&quot; /&gt; Convened by the Academy's founder and first President, [[Samuel L. Mitchill]], the first meeting of the Lyceum took place at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, located on Barclay Street near Broadway in lower [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaatzHistory&quot; /&gt; The principal activities of the early Lyceum focused on hosting lectures, collecting natural history specimens, and establishing a library.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaatzHistory&quot; /&gt; In 1823, the Lyceum began publishing its own scientific journal, then the ''Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York'', now the ''[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]''. By 1826 the Lyceum owned &quot;the richest collection of reptiles and fish in the country,&quot; however a fire in 1866 destroyed the collection completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntellecutalHistory&quot; /&gt; Following the fire, the Academy turned its focus away from collecting and instead to research, scientific publishing, and disseminating scientific information.

Majestic forests that supported abundant animal populations were this nation's inheritance About 95% of those forests have now been removed or radically altered. The organization's goal is to set aside a few forests, at least one in every county where forests can grow, and allow them to recover their old-growth characteristics. These &quot;future old-growth forests&quot; will ensure that generations to follow can experience native forests in their mature diversity and complexity.

c3|The_Planetary_Society:The Planetary Society was founded in 1980 by [[Carl Sagan]], [[Bruce C. Murray|Bruce Murray]], and [[Louis Friedman]] as a champion of public support of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life.  Until his death in 1996, the Society was led by Sagan, who used his celebrity and political clout to influence the political climate of the time, including protecting [[SETI]] in 1981 from congressional cancellation.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Society pushed its scientific and technologic agenda, which led to an increased interest in [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]]-based planetary exploration and [[NASA]]'s [[New Horizons]] mission to [[Pluto]].
c3|The_Planetary_Society:
c3|The_Planetary_Society:In addition to its political affairs, the Society has created a number of space related projects and programs.  The SETI program began with [[Paul Horowitz (scientist)|Paul Horowitz]]'s Suitcase SETI and has grown to encompass searches in radio and optical wavelengths from the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth.  [[SETI@home]], the largest distributed computing experiment on Earth, is perhaps the Society's best-known SETI project.  Other projects include the development of the Mars Microphone instrument which flew on the failed [[Mars Polar Lander]] project, as well as the [[LightSail-1]] project, a [[solar sail]] project to determine if space travel is possible by using only sunlight.

c3|American_Forests:The mission of American Forests is to &quot;protect and restore forests, helping to preserve the health of our planet for the benefit of its inhabitants.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanforests.org/about_us/ |title=– About Us |publisher=American Forests |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Forests' activities comprise five separate program areas: Global ReLeaf forest restoration, Urban Forests, Endangered Western Forests, Big Trees and Public Policy.
c3|American_Forests:
c3|American_Forests:* The '''Global ReLeaf''' program plants millions of trees each year in large-scale forest restoration projects, expanding critical wildlife habitat, cleaning our air and water, and removing millions of tons of pollution and greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Every year, Global ReLeaf partners with local individuals, organizations, agencies and corporations to plant trees to improve the health of the planet and support forest stewards across the country and around the world. The program launched in 1988. Since then, nearly 50 million trees have been planted in all 50 states and 44 countries around the world. No other national non-profit has planted more trees in the US than American Forests.
c3|American_Forests:* The '''Urban Forests''' program raises awareness about the tremendous environmental, social and economic benefits of urban and community trees and greenspaces, and spotlights successful urban forestry programs and best practices across the nation.
c3|American_Forests:* The '''Endangered Western Forests''' initiative partners with federal agencies, local communities and other non-profits to protect and restore forest ecosystems in the West being devastated by disease, insects, climate change and more. The initial phase of the initiative is focused on research, restoration, education and public outreach in the iconic Greater Yellowstone Area.
c3|American_Forests:* The '''National Big Tree''' program enlists hundreds of volunteers from all over the country in locating, protecting and registering the biggest trees, while educating the public about the myriad benefits of mature trees and forests. It is active in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and has been used as a model for many state big tree programs and several international ones, in places such as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Mexico. More than 750 U.S. champions are crowned each year and documented in its biannual publication — the ''[[National Register of Big Trees]]''. For more than 70 years, the goal of the National Big Tree Program has remained: to preserve and promote the iconic stature of these living monarchs and to educate people about the key role that these remarkable trees and forests play in sustaining a healthy environment.

c3|Family_Research_Council:'''Family Research Council''' ('''FRC''') is a non-profit charitable [[501(c)(3) organization]] that is an American [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] group and [[lobbying]] organization. Its stated mission is &quot;to advance faith, family and freedom in public policy and the culture from a Christian worldview&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Research Council|url=http://www.frc.org/mission-statement|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FRC was formed in the United States in 1981 by [[James Dobson]]. It was incorporated in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRCHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=About FRC: History/Mission|newspaper=Family Research Council|date=May 8, 2010|url=http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?c=HISTORY_ABOUT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204154035/http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?c=HISTORY_ABOUT|archivedate=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, FRC officially became a division of Dobson's main organization, [[Focus on the Family]]; however, after an administrative separation, FRC became an independent entity in 1992. [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] is its current president.
c3|Family_Research_Council:
c3|Family_Research_Council:FRC promotes what it considers traditional [[family values]] by advocating and lobbying for [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies. It opposes and lobbies against [[LGBT rights|equal rights for LGBT people]] (such as [[same-sex marriage]], [[civil union|same-sex civil unions]], and [[LGBT adoption]]), [[abortion]], [[divorce]], [[stem cell controversy|embryonic stem-cell research]] and [[pornography]]. FRC is affiliated with a [[501(c)|501(c)(4)]] lobbying [[political action committee|PAC]] known as FRC Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The interest group connection: electioneering, lobbying, and policymaking in Washington|year=2005|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-56802-922-1|page=410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7LuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22frc+action%22&amp;dq=%22frc+action%22|author=Paul S.

c3|Invisible_Children,_Inc.:In 1985, Ugandan dictator [[Apolo Milton Obote]] (December 28, 1925 – October 10, 2005) was overthrown by his own military commanders. Although he was from the [[Langi people|Lango]] ethnic group, the soldiers who made up his army were primarily from the [[Acholi people|Acholi]] region, in northern Uganda. He was replaced by [[Tito Okello]] (1914–1996), the [[president of Uganda]] who was Acholi.

c3|Invisible_Children,_Inc.:
c3|Invisible_Children,_Inc.:Several resistance groups emerged and most were put down, but the LRA survived. In the early 2000s, media attention was drawn to the region when thousands of children affected by the LRA activities took refuge in [[Gulu, Uganda]].

c3|Invisible_Children,_Inc.:Scrutiny of the distribution of the organization's funds have also emerged, specifically due to information reported by charity watch group, [[Charity Navigator]].

c3|Truth_Initiative:== History ==
c3|Truth_Initiative:Truth Initiative was founded in 1999 as a result of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement Agreement]] (MSA).  The MSA was announced in 1998, resolving the lawsuits brought by 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five territories against the major U.S. cigarette companies, to recover state [[Medicaid]] and other costs from caring for sick smokers.  The four other states settled separately.  The tobacco industry agreed to pay the states billions of dollars in perpetuity, making the MSA the then-largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history.  The states directed that a portion of the money they received from the settlement should be used to establish a national public health foundation dedicated to prevent youth smoking and helping smokers quit: the American Legacy Foundation, now Truth Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naag.org/assets/redesign/files/msa-tobacco/MSA.pdf|title=Master Settlement Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=National Association of Attorneys General|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c3|Tsunami_Children_Foundation:The first official fundraiser was Meals for Miracles which yielded a small amount of seed money. Members of TCF began the process of planning a long term action plan in order to focus on extended recovery plans. With the steady guidance of the board, TCF was incorporated and recognized as a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit using the Federal government’s fast track program for tsunami related non-profits. Sometime during this process, English Professor David Hideo Maruyama would also join the team in order to work on documentation and potential grant opportunities.

c3|Center_for_Democracy_and_Technology:In 1994, CDT was founded by [[Jerry Berman]], the former executive director and former policy director of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The battle against applying the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) to the Internet - expanding law enforcement wiretapping capabilities by requiring telephone companies to design their networks to ensure a certain basic level of government access - spurred the creation of CDT in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highlights.cdt.info/moment/calea |title=CDT Timeline |publisher=Highlights.cdt.info |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214516/http://highlights.cdt.info/moment/calea |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing a threat to privacy and innovation in CALEA's design mandates, CDT fought the passage of the CALEA and later worked to ensure that its implementation would not extend to the Internet. In the end, CALEA did not contain wiretapping design mandates for the Internet and required transparency surrounding design standards. Today, CDT leads a strong coalition that fights CALEA expansion, issuing reports by leading security experts that demonstrate how the FBI's latest wiretapping proposal would undermine cybersecurity. CDT's launch was assisted by seed donations from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[Bell Atlantic]], [[Nynex]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/E-journals/CWD/941220.cwd | work=Cyberwire Dispatch | title=Changes in the Wind At EFF | first=Brock | last=Meeks | date=December 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBRP's mission is to bring awareness and education about Japanese American Concentration Camps during World War II, through the prism of their multimedia projects and baseball. Also to recognize the many prewar Issei and Nisei ballplayers that never got an opportunity to play in Major League Baseball because of the 'color line' and their contribution as our American Baseball Ambassadors in the early 1920s and 1930s in Japan, Korea and Manchuko, China. These ballplayers also kept the All-American Pastime alive during their incarceration during World War II as they played 'behind barbed wire' and again were denied of professional MLB careers.

c3|Seven_Bar_Foundation:{{Quotation|I picked women as my vehicle for transformative change because, to put it simply, they are the root of a society from which all else grows. Children's education, the family environment, health care, population growth--these depend on women and the choices they make. I also feel that women, being nurturers, are more likely than males to spend their profits on their children's well-being. Therefore, when you invest in a woman, you help break the cycle of poverty for the next generation.|Renata M. Black, featured in ''The Soul of Leadership'' by [[Deepak Chopra]]|}}

c4|U.S._Family_Network:&quot;Hill also questioned the amount of money U.S. Family spent on fundraising: $665,863 in expenses in 1998, with 60 percent of it going to fundraising and consulting. In 1998 Buckham told ''Roll Call'' that he held the fundraising contract and raised money all over the country for U.S. Family. But fundraising in 1998 should not have been so labor-intensive and costly. One donor gave the group $1 million, and other large contributions included a $150,000, a $100,000, and two gifts of $50,000 – not the sort of contributions that require a big investment in mass mail and phone banks. 'They’re not mailing,' Hill said. 'They are going to the skybox. And one assumes that ordinary citizens are not going there.' (The PAC withholds the names of its donors.) The PAC’s mission statement on its tax return is the 'Promotion of social welfare for American Families' and funding projects to 'promote sound family values legislation.' The skybox, according to Thomas Susman, a lobbying law expert consulted by ''Roll Call'', 'wouldn’t be grassroots.'&quot;

In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent [[Medicaid]] patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated [[Hodgson v. Minnesota]], a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not to comply with a state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v.

Now, they’re calling in their chips. At the National Press Club yesterday, AFP president Tim Phillips and several officers with the group laid out their agenda. The group is calling for legalizing crude oil exports, a repeal of the estate tax, approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, blocking any hike in the gas tax, a tax holiday on corporate profits earned overseas, blocking the EPA’s new rules on carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants, and a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, along with a specific focus on the medical device tax. The announcement was touted by NPR as a &quot;conservative agenda for Congress.&quot; But it’s also a near mirror image of Koch Industries’ lobbying agenda. Koch Industries – the petrochemical, manufacturing and commodity speculating conglomerate owned by David and Charles – is not only a financier of political campaigns, but leads one of the most active lobbying teams in Washington, a big part of why the company has been such a financial success.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David S. |last1=Meyer |first2=Amanda |last2=Pullum |chapter=The Tea Party and the Dilemmas of Conservative Populism |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tPVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=David+S.+Meyer+and+Amanda+Pullum,+%E2%80%9CThe+Tea+Party+and+the+Dilemmas+of+Conservative+Populism.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JvRomAs7IJ&amp;sig=UASAqTZGqQa6n-qikGLXsk687Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMIn9iW-5vCxwIVkyqICh1VYAHJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Understanding the Tea Party Movement |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2014}} in Nella Van Dyke and David S Meyer, eds., * Describes AFP as one of several groups &quot;established before Obama’s election and funded by very wealthy sponsors who sought both to promote an ideological vision and to protect a financial interest.

The organization seeks to make historic preservation a national priority by advocating to all branches of the federal government for sound preservation policy and programs through a grassroots constituency of hundreds of members from throughout the United States. Preservation Action provides information and training, and encourages direct contact with elected representatives, with National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week being the highlight of advocacy and outreach efforts each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preservationaction.org/about_us2.htm |title=Mission &amp; Vision |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=Preservation Action |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c4|Preservation_Action:==History==
c4|Preservation_Action:Preservation Action came about after the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1968. Early in the 1970s, preservation leaders realized that achieving their goals required substantial increases in federal support. This included especially the need for appropriations for federal-state preservation programs, changes in laws and regulations, and an understanding of the U.S. Congress and the federal government of the benefits of historic preservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt; Preservation Action proved instrumental in the passage of various laws and amendments, including the [[Tax Reform Act of 1976]]. Following the success of these early advocacy efforts, the focus shifted slightly to helping local organizations advocate for preservation in their own communities and states as well as continuing to lobby Congress for increased funding for federal preservation projects and agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stubbs&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIkLY7ZPmUcC&amp;lpg=PA459&amp;dq=%22preservation%20action%22%20%22historic%20preservation%22%20%22united%20states%22&amp;pg=PA459#v=onepage&amp;q=%22preservation%20action%22%20%22historic%20preservation%22%20%22united%20states%22&amp;f=false |title=Architectural Conservation in Europe and the Americas |last1=Stubbs |first1=John H. |last2=Makaš |first2=Emily G. |last3=Bouchenaki |first3=Mounir |date=5 April 2011 |work= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c4|Alaska_Federation_of_Natives:The Alaska Federation of Natives was formed in October 1966, when more than 400 Alaska Natives representing 17 Native organizations gathered for a three-day conference to address Alaska Native aboriginal land rights. The 1968 discovery of oil prompted Native leaders to push for a land claims settlement with unprecedented urgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.nativefederation.org/about-afn/history/|website=Alaska Federation of Natives|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially incorporated on January 8, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/CBP/Main/CorporationDetail.aspx?id=9148D Alaska Federation of Natives, Inc.]&quot; ''Corporations, Business &amp; Professional Licensing Division''. Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. Accessed on May 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966 to 1971, AFN worked primarily to achieve passage of a just and fair land settlement. On December 18, 1971, the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) was signed into law.
c4|Alaska_Federation_of_Natives:
c4|Alaska_Federation_of_Natives:In the early- and mid-1970s, AFN provided technical assistance to help Alaska Natives implement ANCSA and set up the corporations mandated by the Act.

c4|Democratic_Leadership_Council:In May 2003, as the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|Democratic primary]] of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]] was starting to pick up, the organization voiced concern that the Democratic contenders might be taking positions too far left of the mainstream general electorate. Early front-runner [[Howard Dean]], who attracted popular support due in large part to his anti-war views despite his reputation as a centrist governor of [[Vermont]], was specifically criticized by DLC founder and CEO Al From. From's criticism of Dean was also likely due to the former governor's opposition to the [[Iraq War]], which most party centrists, including From, endorsed. Dean's claim to hail &quot;from the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party&quot; (a phrase originally used by Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of [[Minnesota]]) has been interpreted by some as subtle(?) criticism of the DLC and the New Democrats in general. Indeed, Dean once described the DLC as the &quot;Republican wing of the Democratic Party.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/election2004/columnist/klein/article/0,18471,574861,00.html|title=Will the Real Howard Dean Please Stand Up?|last=Klein|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Klein|date=11 January 2004|website=time.com|publisher=[[Time Magazine|Time (magazine)]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024123537/http://www.time.com/time/election2004/columnist/klein/article/0%2C18471%2C574861%2C00.html|archive-date=24 October 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=4 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLC countered that Dean represented the &quot;McGovern-Mondale wing&quot; of the Democratic Party, &quot;defined principally by weakness abroad and elitist, interest-group liberalism at home.&quot;

c4|One_Laptop_per_Child:The OLPC program has its roots in the pedagogy of [[Seymour Papert]], an approach known as [[constructionism (learning theory)|constructionism]], which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with [[Nicholas Negroponte]], were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception. Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books chained to the walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils. However, this pattern seemed to be inevitable, given the then-high prices of computers (over $1,500 apiece for a typical laptop or small desktop by 2004).
c4|One_Laptop_per_Child:
c4|One_Laptop_per_Child:In 2005, Negroponte spoke at the [[World Economic Forum]], in Davos. In this talk he urged industry to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos to whip up support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Economy; At Davos, the Johnny Appleseed of the digital era shares his ambition to propagate a $100 laptop in developing countries.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DA153BF932A05752C0A9639C8B63|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reported skepticism of [[Bill Gates]] and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms.
c4|One_Laptop_per_Child:From the outset, it was clear that Negroponte thought that the key to reducing the cost of the laptop was to reduce the cost of the display. Thus, when, upon return from Davos, he met [[Mary Lou Jepsen]], the display pioneer who was in early 2005 joining the MIT Media Lab faculty, the discussions turned quickly to display innovation to enable a low-cost laptop. Convinced that the project was now possible, Negroponte led the creation of the first corporation for this: the Hundred Dollar Laptop Corp.

c4|Susan_B._Anthony_List:
c4|Susan_B._Anthony_List:Founded in 1993 by sociologist and psychologist [[Rachel MacNair]], the SBA List was a response to the success of the [[pro-choice]] group [[EMILY's List]], which was partly responsible for bringing about the 1992 &quot;[[Year of the Woman]]&quot; in which a significant number of women, all pro-choice, were elected to Congress. MacNair wished to help anti-abortion women gain high public office. She recruited [[Marjorie Dannenfelser]] and Jane Abraham as the first experienced leaders of SBA List. Dannenfelser is now president of the organization and Abraham is chairwoman of the board. Named for suffragist [[Susan B. Anthony]], SBA List identifies itself with Anthony and several 19th-century women's rights activists; SBA List argues that Anthony and other early feminists were opposed to abortion. Regarding Anthony's beliefs, the SBA List has been challenged by scholars and [[pro-choice]] activists. Anthony scholar [[Ann D. Gordon]] and Anthony biographer [[Lynn Sherr]] write that Anthony &quot;spent no time on the politics of abortion&quot;.&lt;ref name=GordonSherr&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/05/sarah_palin_is_no_susan_b_anthony.html |title=Sarah Palin is no Susan B.

c4|Susan_B._Anthony_List:The SBA List employs many strategies in order to attract the public to its mission. Lawyer and Scholar Tali Leinwand explains that the SBA List encourages Republicans not to endorse personhood amendments, and attempts to link the pro-life movement to less controversial causes like opposition to the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leinwand|first=Tali|year=2016|title=STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: THE DESTIGMATIZATION OF ANTI-ABORTION REFORM|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1779236190|journal=Columbia Journal of Gender and Law|volume=30|pages=529–548|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies, Leinwand argues, attempt to de-stigmatize the pro-life movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
